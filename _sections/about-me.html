<p>Hello, I'm Kieran, a Physical Natural Sciences student at the University of Cambridge. I am incredibly interested in physics, and my goal is to utilise natural phenomena to develop devices that benefit people, through research. I am contributing to this goal through my school and university work, unique photonics and optoelectronics projects, summer schools, work experience and continuous, dedicated study. </p>

</br>

<p>As a child, I was interested in a variety of subjects, including Astronomy, Palaeontology and History. My interest in physics was sparked five years ago by the net effect of good popular science books, documentaries and a brilliant physics teacher. I have fed my interest with countless articles and other forms of media, gradually increasing the intensity of my study.
Aged 13, I received one of my 4 English Speaking Board distinctions following a presentation I prepared
on Isaac Newton. This helped to establish my interest in physics, which has been sustained and continually enhanced up to
my most recent achievements.</p>

On this site, I discuss some of my many previous and current involvements, including:

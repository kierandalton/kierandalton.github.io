<p>As a child, I was interested in a variety of subjects, including Astronomy, Palaeontology and History. My interest in physics was sparked five years ago by the net effect of good popular science books, documentaries and a brilliant physics teacher. I have fed my interest with countless articles and other forms of media, gradually increasing the intensity of my study.
Aged 13, I received one of my 4 English Speaking Board distinctions following a presentation I prepared
on Isaac Newton. This helped to establish my interest in Physics, which has been sustained through to
my achievement of 100 UMS in all my AS exams.
During two summer holidays, I worked for 6 weeks with the Photonics Academy of Wales, investigating
various Photonics concepts, before experimental work with polarising filters and birefringent materials led
me to choose polarised light as a project theme. I studied the linear polarisation characteristics of
Rayleigh Scattering in the blue light of the sky, before designing and building a solar tracking device that
utilised three coordinate systems to allow a photovoltaic cell to track the Sun. I completed this project
during August 2017, together with a scientific report published to my blog, appletoearth.blogspot.co.uk.
The first system consisted of an array of 7 Photodiodes controlling the photovoltaic cell’s vertical
orientation, while the second system utilised the azimuth of highest degree of linear polarisation,
orthogonal to the Sun’s incident direction, to control the horizontal orientation. The third system reset the
angular orientation of the entire project at night. The optoelectronic circuitry which I designed and
constructed included Photodiodes, Operational Amplifiers, Voltage Comparators, Monostables and
Multivibrators (for the Servo Drivers), together with D-flip flops and the entire logic control circuitry.
In addition, I led an Engineering Education Scheme Wales team to design and construct a Self-Levelling
Platform able to be pre-set to return to any angular orientation relative to the horizontal. This project
incorporated a Lenticular Grating, Laser Diode, Rotational Optical Encoder, and processing circuitry. The
grating divided the laser beam into multiple beams which were selectively incident on 6 specific optical
fibres which formed the sensing mechanism. The Optical Encoder indicated the pre-set angle to which
the platform could return. After competing with 25 other teams, we won the AIRBUS ‘Best Application of
Engineering and Technology’ award (and CREST Gold awards), qualifying for the 2018 National Big
Bang Final. Leadership gave me experience in organising a project involving extensive circuit design and
testing.
I am also passionate about Mathematics, and I volunteer to teach year 7 pupils Mathematical concepts
beyond their curriculum. I achieved Gold in the Senior Mathematical Challenge and a Merit in the
subsequent Kangaroo, while also participating in the Team Mathematical Challenge regional final, where
we won Best State School. As Head Boy, I organised the S5 voluntary Junior Teaching Scheme for
Reading and Mathematics, and as a member of the Sixth Form Council, I helped organise charity work
such as Children in Need. The Rotary Youth Leadership Award 2016 gave me the opportunity to lead a
group of students through challenging activities, and as a qualified Assistant Lifesaving Instructor, I
volunteer to teach young pupils skills such as First Aid (Life Support 3).
In July, I was the only British attendee of the International Summer School for Young Physicists at the
Perimeter Institute in Canada. I was one of 40 International students studying advanced Physics
concepts, such as Special Relativity, with lectures from renowned researchers in various fields of
Theoretical Physics. Specifically, my mentorship group focused on Quantum Computing, including the
Grover Search algorithm and Shor Code, culminating in a group presentation on the topic. One highlight
was the visit to SNOLAB, where we were guided through the experiments in their subterranean clean
room. In August, I attended Work Experience with the Isaac Physics group at the Cavendish Laboratory,
where I assisted in writing questions and concept pages for their website. I valued the opportunity to
perform undergraduate experiments, such as investigating thin lens uses.</p>

                                <p>During two summer holidays, I worked for 6 weeks with the Photonics Academy of Wales, investigating various Photonics concepts, before experimental work with polarising filters and birefringent materials led me to choose polarised light as a project theme. I studied the linear polarisation characteristics of Rayleigh Scattering in the blue light of the sky, before designing and building a solar tracking device that utilised three coordinate systems to allow a photovoltaic cell to track the Sun. I completed this project during August 2017, together with a scientific report (which can be viewed below).</p> <p>The first system consisted of an array of 7 Photodiodes controlling the photovoltaic cell’s vertical orientation, while the second system utilised the azimuth of highest degree of linear polarisation, orthogonal to the Sun’s incident direction, to control the horizontal orientation. The third system reset the angular orientation of the entire project at night. The optoelectronic circuitry which I designed and constructed included Photodiodes, Operational Amplifiers, Voltage Comparators, Monostables and Multivibrators (for the Servo Drivers), together with D-flip flops and the entire logic control circuitry.</p>

                                <p>I led an Engineering Education Scheme Wales team to design and construct a Self-Levelling Platform able to be pre-set to return to any angular orientation relative to the horizontal. This project incorporated a Lenticular Grating, Laser Diode, Rotational Optical Encoder, and processing circuitry. The grating divided the laser beam into multiple beams which were selectively incident on 6 specific optical fibres which formed the sensing mechanism. The Optical Encoder indicated the pre-set angle to which the platform could return. After competing with 25 other teams, we won the AIRBUS ‘Best Application of Engineering and Technology’ award (and CREST Gold awards), qualifying for the 2018 National Big Bang Final. Leadership gave me experience in organising a project involving extensive circuit design and testing. Resulting from the Big Bang Final, I was awarded the EESW Runner-Up Engineer of the Year Award.</p>

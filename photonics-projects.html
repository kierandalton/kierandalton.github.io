<p>	During two summer holidays, I worked for 6 weeks with the Photonics Academy of Wales, investigating
various Photonics concepts, before experimental work with polarising filters and birefringent materials led
me to choose polarised light as a project theme. I studied the linear polarisation characteristics of
Rayleigh Scattering in the blue light of the sky, before designing and building a solar tracking device that
utilised three coordinate systems to allow a photovoltaic cell to track the Sun. I completed this project
during August 2017, together with a scientific report published to my blog, appletoearth.blogspot.co.uk.
The first system consisted of an array of 7 Photodiodes controlling the photovoltaic cell’s vertical
orientation, while the second system utilised the azimuth of highest degree of linear polarisation,
orthogonal to the Sun’s incident direction, to control the horizontal orientation. The third system reset the
angular orientation of the entire project at night. The optoelectronic circuitry which I designed and
constructed included Photodiodes, Operational Amplifiers, Voltage Comparators, Monostables and
Multivibrators (for the Servo Drivers), together with D-flip flops and the entire logic control circuitry.
</br></br>	In addition, I led an Engineering Education Scheme Wales team to design and construct a Self-Levelling
Platform able to be pre-set to return to any angular orientation relative to the horizontal. This project
incorporated a Lenticular Grating, Laser Diode, Rotational Optical Encoder, and processing circuitry. The
grating divided the laser beam into multiple beams which were selectively incident on 6 specific optical
fibres which formed the sensing mechanism. The Optical Encoder indicated the pre-set angle to which
the platform could return. After competing with 25 other teams, we won the AIRBUS ‘Best Application of
Engineering and Technology’ award (and CREST Gold awards), qualifying for the 2018 National Big
Bang Final. Leadership gave me experience in organising a project involving extensive circuit design and
testing. Resulting from the Big Bang Final, I was awarded the EESW Runner-Up Engineer of the Year Award.<p>

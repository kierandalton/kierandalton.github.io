I am also passionate about Mathematics, and I volunteer to teach Year 7 pupils Mathematical concepts
beyond their curriculum. In 2017, I achieved Gold in the Senior Mathematical Challenge (with Best in School) and a Merit in the
subsequent Kangaroo, while also participating in the Team Mathematical Challenge regional final, where
we won Best State School.

In 2018, I retained the Best in School award with another Senior Mathematical Challenge Gold, qualifying for the British Mathematical Olympiad Round 1, and subsequently Round 2.

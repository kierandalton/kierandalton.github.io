The Rotary Youth Leadership Award (RYLA) gave me the opportunity to experience exciting outdoor activities, competitive problem solving tasks in teams, diplomatic negotiations and common business roles. These were combined together in the 'Business Game'.
This involved 4 teams competitively running separate business to achieve overall
goals, which were the greatest revenue and the completion of a final raft building challenge.

QCSYS Diary

In Summer 2018, I attended the Quantum Cryptography School for Young Students at the Institute for Quantum Computing. This involved multiple courses of lectures covering quantum mechanics, classical and quantum cryptography, linear algebra and the theory and implementation of quantum cryptography and quantum computing. We performed experiments and had small group discussions with the resident researchers.

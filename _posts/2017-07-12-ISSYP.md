In July, I was the only British attendee of the International Summer School for Young Physicists at the Perimeter Institute in Canada. I was one of 40 International students studying advanced Physics concepts, such as Special Relativity, with lectures from renowned researchers in various fields of Theoretical Physics. Specifically, my mentorship group focused on Quantum Computing, including the Grover Search algorithm and Shor Code, culminating in a group presentation on the topic. One highlight was the visit to SNOLAB, where we were guided through the experiments in their subterranean clean room.

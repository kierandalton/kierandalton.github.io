Alongside my formal qualifications, [GCSEs (Click here for more information)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2016-06-20-GCSE %}) and [A Levels (Click Here for more information)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-06-20-A-Levels %}), I have had many other school 
involvements that I think are worthy of mentioning. I am passionate about Mathematics, and I 
volunteer to teach year 7 pupils Mathematical concepts beyond their curriculum.

As Head Boy, I organised the S5 voluntary Junior Teaching Scheme for
Reading and Mathematics, and as a member of the Sixth Form Council, I helped organise charity work
such as Children in Need.

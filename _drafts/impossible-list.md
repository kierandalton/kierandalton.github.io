Like a bucket list, the 'Impossible List' is a list of goals, but it continuously evolves as goals are reached, and is hence impossible to ever complete. This list was inspired by that of [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/).

I aim to continually update this list as goals are achieved, and new goals are added. Effective goals are: *Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-Bound*
